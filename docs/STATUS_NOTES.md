## Project Overview

**Vica Domino** is an educational math game built as a single-page web app under the **Pinky Math Gaming** brand. The primary game is **"Find the Double"** — a domino-based game where players must identify the double card from a dealt hand before time runs out. It supports 1-2 human players plus an optional AI opponent ("Xeno"), custom card creation, and multi-stage game progression.

### Tech Stack
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** — no frameworks or build tools
- **SVG-based** card and icon rendering
- **localStorage** for persistence (games, cards, variations, arrangements)
- **Single `index.html`** with inline scripts + external `game.js` and `domino.js`

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### Known Issues / Incomplete Areas

1. **Code Organization**
   - `index.html` is 6,373 lines with significant inline JavaScript — should be extracted into separate JS modules
   - `css/style.css` at 4,584 lines could be split into component-specific files
   - `game.js` at 3,617 lines handles too many concerns (game logic, UI, animations, timer, tutorial)
   - No build system, bundler, or minification

2. **Testing**
   - No automated tests exist (no unit tests, integration tests, or E2E tests)
   - All testing has been manual

3. **ABC Card Set**
   - Only 5 picture icons implemented (Ant, Brain, Cat, Dog, Egg) for letters A-E
   - Remaining 20 letters (F-Y) need picture icons
   - Card designs for letters F-Y are basic/default

4. **Classic Domino Mode**
   - Less polished compared to Sun Level "Find the Double" mode
   - Most recent development focused on Sun Level; classic mode may have edge cases

5. **Mobile/Touch**
   - Responsive layouts exist but may need further testing on actual devices
   - Touch interactions (drag-and-drop for card reordering) may not work smoothly on all touch devices

6. **Accessibility**
   - No ARIA labels or screen reader support
   - No high-contrast mode
   - Color-dependent game elements with no alternative indicators

7. **Audio**
   - Only one audio file (`select-double.mp3`)
   - Wah-wah disapproval sound is generated programmatically (Web Audio API)
   - Could add more audio feedback (win sounds, card click sounds, timer warnings)

8. **Performance**
   - Large single HTML file (6K+ lines) loaded all at once
   - localStorage used extensively — no cleanup/garbage collection of old data
   - No lazy loading of card sets or game data

9. **Multiplayer Enhancements**
   - No online/networked multiplayer — only local same-device
   - No score persistence across sessions
   - No leaderboard or player profiles

10. **Game Content**
    - Limited to "Find the Double" and Classic Domino modes
    - Combined Games feature exists but needs more game variety
    - Card sets limited to Numbers & Dots and ABC

11. **Documentation**
    - Existing docs (`MEMORY.md`, `project-details.md`) cover architecture but are from Feb 14
    - No user-facing documentation/help within the app
    - No in-app tutorial beyond the progressive finger animation

12. **Deployment**
    - No hosting/deployment pipeline
    - No PWA support (offline capability, installable)
    - No service worker for caching

## March 4, 2026 Session — Card/Game Identity & Deletion Fixes

### Summary
Fixed a cluster of related bugs around game/card identity, cross-set confusion, and deletion not sticking. The root cause was that both card sets (ABC and Numbers & Dots) share the same label format (A1, B1, C1...), and several systems didn't distinguish between them.

### Changes Made (5 commits)

1. **Skip deleted cards when building game deck** (`startCustomGame`)
   - Cards removed from card sets but still stored in saved game data appeared during gameplay
   - Now cards are included only if they have stored `svgMarkup` OR exist in the card library DOM
   - Cards with neither (truly deleted, no fallback) are skipped
   - Key code: `index.html` lines ~5647-5650

2. **Scope `findCardByLabel` to the correct card set**
   - `findCardByLabel(label)` searched the entire DOM and returned the first match — wrong set if ABC appears before Numbers
   - Added optional `cardSet` parameter: `findCardByLabel(label, cardSet)`
   - When `cardSet` is `'ABC'`, searches only `#card-set-abc`; when `'Numbers and Dots'`, searches only `#card-set-numbers`; when omitted, searches everything (backward compatible)
   - Updated all callers that have `cardSet` info: `buildGameViewCard`, `getGameCardSVG`, `getGameVariationSVG`, `startCustomGame`, `buildGameViewVariations`, migration code
   - Callers without `cardSet` (variation restoration) still search all sets

3. **Removed hardcoded "Dots and Numbers" button from intro screen**
   - Line 18 had a hardcoded `<button>` that always showed regardless of user's games
   - Removed the button, the `selectIntroGame('dots-and-numbers')` highlight code, and the `goToMainPage()` branch for it
   - Intro screen now only shows dynamically populated games from `savedCustomGames` and `savedCombinedGames`

4. **Fixed ABC game cards not loading (plain letters instead of SVGs)**
   - The ABC card set DOM (`#card-set-abc`) is only populated when the user opens it in the card maker via `buildAbcCardSet()`
   - When starting a game, `findCardByLabel(label, 'ABC')` found nothing in the empty container
   - Original code skipped all cards → empty SVG map → dominos showed plain text fallback
   - Fixed: card inclusion now checks `hasMarkup || inDom` — cards with stored `svgMarkup` are included even if not in the DOM

5. **Stopped auto-recreating the ABC game on every page load**
   - `ensureAbcGameExists()` ran on every page load and re-created the ABC game if deleted
   - Replaced with `migrateAbcGameMarkup()` — a one-time migration that only backfills missing `svgMarkup` on an *existing* ABC game, never re-creates a deleted one

### Key Architecture Insights

- **Card identity is label + cardSet**: Labels like "A1" are NOT unique across the app. The `cardSet` property (`'ABC'` or `'Numbers and Dots'`) is required to disambiguate.
- **DOM vs stored data**: Card SVGs live in two places: (1) the card library DOM (built lazily per set), and (2) `svgMarkup` stored in `savedCustomGames`. Game loading must try DOM first, then fall back to stored markup.
- **Game data is a snapshot**: When a game is created, card data (including SVG markup) is copied into `savedCustomGames`. Deleting cards from a set doesn't automatically clean up game data — the game uses its stored copy as fallback.
- **ABC DOM is lazy**: `#card-set-abc` starts empty. `buildAbcCardSet()` populates it only when the user opens the ABC set in the card maker. Any code that needs ABC cards at startup must handle the empty-DOM case.

### Potential Follow-up Issues
- **Combined games referencing deleted games**: If a user deletes a game that's part of a combined game, the combined game still appears on the intro screen. `resolveStageGameIndex` looks up by name — if the game is gone, it returns -1 and `startCustomGame` silently fails. Could show a warning or auto-clean.
- **Orphaned localStorage keys**: When a game is deleted, `excludedDominos_N` and `excludedVariations_N` keys are removed for the deleted index, but indices shift — keys for games after the deleted one may become misaligned.
- **Custom card sets**: The `findCardByLabel` fix only handles `'ABC'` and `'Numbers and Dots'` containers. If custom card sets (stored in `#card-set-custom`) are used in games, they'd fall through to searching the full DOM.

## Quick Start for New Session

1. The project is at `/home/user/Vica_Domino` on branch `claude/review-project-docs-QNagl`
2. Main files: `index.html` (UI + inline scripts), `js/game.js` (game logic), `js/domino.js` (card data), `css/style.css` (styles)
3. No build step — open `index.html` directly in a browser
4. All state persisted in localStorage
5. Most recent work (March 4): Card/game identity fixes — `findCardByLabel` scoped by card set, deleted cards skipped from game deck, hardcoded intro button removed, ABC game no longer auto-recreated
